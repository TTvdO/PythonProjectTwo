# python project two = classifying cats vs dogs with machine learning
import tensorflow as tf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn import preprocessing


# steps:

# DATA
# -reference and store petimages in a variable
# -loop through pet images by finding a way to reference the Cat folder and the Dog folder respectively. anything in the Cat folder gets the label 0, Dogs get label 1
# -make sure all the images are the same size by hardcoding the size to e.g. 50 by 50
# -shuffle the data
# -assign variable X to all the attributes besides the label(the features), assign variable to all the labels of the data
# -figure out how to format this data in order to pass it onto the algorithm that will classify the data

# ALGORITHM
# -fit the algorithm with the data (train), using the X_train and y_train data
# -predict the list of all the features, compared to the actual label values. a.k.a. use the predict method in which you pass the X_test and y_test
